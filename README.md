# Spam-Email-Detection-Using-AI
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
The Objectives of spam email detection are as follows:</br>
• The primary objective of spam email detection is to accurately identify unsolicited emails,
commonly known as spam. This helps ensure that users only receive legitimate and desired
emails in their inboxes.</br>
• Spam detection systems strive to continually improve their accuracy and precision in
identifying spam emails. This involves the use of advanced algorithms, machine learning
techniques. Designing a model with highest accuracy using machine learning algorithm
is also a goal.
